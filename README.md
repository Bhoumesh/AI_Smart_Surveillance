# AI-Based Smart Surveillance System

## Project Description
This project is a real-time AI-based smart surveillance system developed using Python and OpenCV. It detects motion and identifies human presence using face detection techniques.

## Features
- Real-time webcam monitoring
- Motion detection using frame difference
- Human detection using face detection
- Automatic image capture
- Timestamp on video feed

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## How to Run
1. Install Python
2. Install required libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the project:
   python main.py

## Output
Detected motion and human presence are highlighted with bounding boxes. Images are saved automatically in the captures folder.

## Use Case
- Home surveillance
- Office security
- Educational computer vision project
